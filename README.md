# Face-Recognition-System
This project is a real-time Face Recognition System built using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It captures facial images via webcam, stores them as NumPy arrays, and recognizes faces using a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Haar Cascade is used for detection, and Euclidean distance enables accurate classification through majority voting.
